𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗟𝗟𝗔𝗠𝗔𝗧𝗮𝗹𝗸 𝗶𝘀 𝗦𝗽𝗲𝗰𝗶𝗮𝗹:
This project focuses on making conversational AI accessible, cost-effective, and private. While the app integrates with LangChain APIs for efficient prompt orchestration and workflow management, the core AI model runs locally on your CPU via the Ollama framework, ensuring no sensitive data is shared with remote AI providers like OpenAI or Hugging Face. This combination minimizes dependence on heavy cloud infrastructure while optimizing performance.
